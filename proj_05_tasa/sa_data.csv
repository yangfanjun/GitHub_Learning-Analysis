"As I reflect on the idea of community, think about the reading in chapter 1, and the information that I found online, is the fact that the ideas around and the definition of community has made many changes in the past several years. _My first thought on ""community"" sent me to my childhood neighborhood. _A place where a group of people lived and interacted together. _Merriam and Webster define community as ""a group of people who live in the same area, a group of people who have the same interest, religion or race"". _This definition I would say has been the main idea of community for decades. However, now we have a new and modern idea of something called the ""Virtual Community"". _The internet has taken the idea of living in the same area away. _Now we are able to be a part of a community regardless of our location. _I have been part of an online community for the past three years here at the University. _During my first year it was a time of intense learning. _I was not used to the online learning tools, and it took me a while to feel confident in myself as a learner. _Chapter one did a nice job of laying out what it takes to be successful with online communities. _At first, I had a hard time trusting myself to be able to complete the work without the instructor on hand. _I also had to develop a game plan for myself as much of the learning and time frame is based on your time line. _After three years of being a part of the online community. _I feel that I know what I am doing. _I am willing to put myself out their in my posts and willing to share my ideas with the class and the instructor.

"Hi, B. I am totally agree with your points. Sharing and chatting in online community is fun, and we at the same time could learn something or reflect on our previous thoughts, experiences",MKC
"Hi B - I really like your comment,""What I love about online communities is that it bring together a group of people who may never have connected."" This is a key component to an online learning environment and provides a great framework to build a strong community in that it allows members to bring forward their own experiences and relate them to others in the course/community",MKC
"Hi, B and C,I agree! Your line about a group of people who may never have connected resonated with me, as well. I think what I have enjoyed most about online social media as I have wandered through it more or less consciously roe deliberately over the years, is that I have encountered so many people with so many varied perspectives that I'm ought never have gotten to know--almost certainly would not have gotten to know--any other way. My worldview has definitely expanded as a result,",DKC
"Hi B,I like your discussion of how the definition of ""community"" has evolved. I also really like your point about one of the benefits of online communities, which is bringing together a group of people that may never have come together.Thanks!",SKC
"B - I agree with you about community in the neighborhood sense. That was my first intro to community when I was growing up as well. I am new to formal online learning, but I've been hanging out in social media spaces for a few years now, and finally feel like I am getting the hang of interacting in those kinds of communities. It definitely takes a while to learn how to interact online.Have you found other online learning communities that have been helpful as you've been going through the program?",SKC

The only other community has been through Moodle and it has some of the same features as Ning.  I had never done a Voicethread and that was something fun to try.  Also online intros have been new.  I think that these pieces have been really interesting to be able to put a name with a face and have made me feel more connected early on to the group,MKC
"Hi B, in my opinion, Moodle is course management system while Ning is more like social networking site :)",MKC
"It is crazy sometimes to think of ""virtual community"" _we have come so far with technology.I recall my first online class and I hated it. _I was soooooo scared of not clicking the right area, or I was missing a site to visit. _I would get frustrated and need a teacher right now!!!I am now in my last stretch of Master degree and I stayed with online classes (all). _I am enjoying the community in-which I live in as a student. _This is my second time in Ning, and I am enjoying this site as much as the others.... _You move fast, but it keeps the learning fun and to the point!",MKC
"When I think about defining online community, I think about how I as a program evaluator would think about it as an intervention in learning and what that may ""look like"". I reviewed a few published studies that evaluated different online communities (learning and professional). _The online communities that ""succeeded"" by some measure included these aspects: high engagement (measured by frequency of participation, depth of participation, or particular participation patterns), shared sense of vision (in most cases this was centered on a particular aspect of learning), _and sense of belonging or community loyalty (self report paired with measures of participation). The studies also discussed motivations such as relevance of knowledge sharing in community and perceived advantage of belonging and participating. The studies also either measured or discussed the role of self efficacy in fostering engagement. Participants needed to be confident enough in their own ability to share knowledge to be engaged.In a learning community it seems like it would be important to figure out what strengths different members bring to the table, scaffold discussions so that varied expertise is valued, and establish the trust among members early and consistently. I liked the ""Building Online Learning Communities' reference to conscious community - the need for personal growth and transformation as part of that definition.The other piece that seemed missing from the studies I found was thinking about the role of discourse in building knowledge or learning in the community. It was perhaps implicit in the different measures of weblogs aItics from these studies but that seems to miss the constructivist thinking that R described in Prezi.Thinking about the definition makes me realize the challenges of thinking about evaluation with respect to online communities.",SKI

"Great points, E. Figuring out strengths with one another is definitely a challenge, and with such little time (15 weeks) for a semester, it's not always easy to determine those. But, I like your ideas of scaffolding discussions to help build in different levels of expertise. Thanks!",MKC

"E- I really like that you pointed out in order for online communities to be successful you need high engagement.  I think sometimes people think online classes are ""easy"".  However, if you are going to do them right and be successful you really need to be engaged and spend a lot of time participating in the community",MKC
"I envision ""online community"" as a place where people of all kind from all over the world comes together online to work and or learn together. Online communities occur when individuals come together for a sense of purpose. I would say that our class on this Ning website is an example of an online community. We come together and engage in conversations to enhance our learning and understanding. Slowly we become comfortable with one another so that the space shared in our online community is a safe place. We all have a common interest in choosing this class and taking this class. Each person may have a different reason for taking this class as we stated in our voicethreads the first week of class, but we had the option to come together to take this class and share the space here. I envision online learning communities as a place where people could freely express their self and keep an open mind to what they would like to share with other people within the community.",MKI

"I, I definitely agree that an online learning community should be a place where people can express freely and keep an open mind to other people's opinions. I think sometimes this can be a little harder in an online class because when people are having a discussion you are only ever reading their responses. You are not able to read someone's body language and other things that people take advantage of when they are face to face. But if everyone is open minded I think people's differences in opinions can be amazing in an online learning community because it gets everyone thinking.",MKC
"J, _I agree with you, it is definitely harder to express yourself through an online class since you don't get to hear how each person verbally contributes. I would say the pro of having online classes would be being able to see those who are quieter in a typical lecture classroom engaging and expressing their thoughts and opinions.",DKC
I- I agree I think this class is going to be a really good online community.  I really liked the voicethreads that we did the first week as this activity really gave us a better understanding about the members of the group.  This is my fist time using Ning- but so far I think it is going to be a really neat tool to use in this community,MKC
"I too would agree this will be a great online community with structure, entertainment, variety of learning opportunities....I also feel many programs are turning to online connections that will hopefully amount to a successful online community. _Programs that are spread out over distance may have to save money and start building resources around internet. _some of the personalized one on one may get lost in the mix, but as we are learning there are so many ways to ""see"" classmates or co-workers and also when you become familiar with online, you can eventually begin to ""read"" body language. _I know I can tell when someone is ready to debate a subject _... yikes _:) _its all good....",SKC

"I would agree with what you said. It's definitely successful to have online communities and classes. Last semester I had a student from the Duluth campus as a group member for an online class. I was quite shocked, but at the same time, when I thought about it, I liked the idea of having classmates from different campuses as well",MKC
"I define ""online community"" as a place where people from all over engages in some type of online work whether it is for some type of service or just for to connect with others in the world. Wikipedia stated that online community can be an information system whether people can post up information whether if it is open to everyone to post or private to only a few certain people able to post. The other big form of of online community is a form of communication for people. Communities would either be more like a blogging pages or social media sites like Facebook. As stated above it would feel like the online communities would mainly be used to connect with people or used as a source to give out information and find information. Online learning communities help bond people together who may not know each other before. For example, online classes at the University of Minnesota help colleagues like us bond together. It's a shared place where we all come together and learn more about one another through our interactions. There's a sense of ""purpose"" that each online community hold. The ""purpose"" of each online community varies depending on the structure of the community.",MKI

"Hi K! - I agree with you that an online community can be many different types such as facebook, online search engines and blogging type sites.  I think that it is interesting that we can create relationships and think collaboratively with others over many different types of online communities.  There is definitely a sense of purpose that each different online community has to offer",MKC
"K,I agree that each online community has their own purpose to it. At first when I thought about online communities, I thought they were all similar and ""what's the purpose of having Facebook when it's just like Myspace?"" always comes to my mind. However, after thinking it through, they may both be generally the same, a place for social networking, but Facebook is more about being able to browse through what your friends wish to share and to comment on it, while Myspace is more about conversations on each other's Myspace page",MKC

"I firmly believe that community is important in online learning spaces because without a doubt it builds collaboration. Without community (and a strong community that is), you lack engagement, trust, and respect from members of the online learning space, which makes the online space seem void; serving no purpose. Community in an online learning space allows members to create a sense of ownership and connection to others. In the paper, Building a Dynamic Online Learning Community among Adult Learners, it notes evidence of an online community forming from three markers: active participation, the forming of a shared identity, and the establishment of a social network. Without participation, you lack interaction, and therefore lack any opportunities to learn from each other (such through constructivism or active learning [noted in our book]). Our book really sums it up well in the first chapter, ""The development of community as part of the learning process helps create a learning experience that is powerful and rich.""",MKI

"hmmm...good question, E! I'm not entirely sure how someone would move from lurker to contributer...maybe someone else in the community personally reached out to that person and contacted/talked to him/her - that interaction might prompt that person to then interact in more ways in the community, or with additional community members. Just some thoughts off the top of my head. Does anyone else have ideas with this? I'm curious too..",MKC

One thing that may move a person from lurker to participant is becoming more knowledgeable, either about the community and its norms (because it's someone who has arrived recently and wants to find out what it's like there) or about the subject matter. If I'm coming in cold, I like to suss out a group a bit before I participate. In a class like this, there's a context and expectations established by the facilitator, but in a more open online community, I would probably hang out awhile without talking",DKC
"When I first think about community I immediately go to community in a classroom. As a future elementary education teacher this is something we talk about often in our classes. We want to create a community for our students where they can feel safe and comfortable but also where they are able to expand their knowledge as students and as individuals. When I think about an online learning community I think these same values are important. People need to be able to feel safe and comfortable to express their opinions without feeling as though they are going to be attacked if their opinions aren't the same as everyone else's. That being said if everyone is open minded to other's opinions online learning communities are great because you get to work with people and learn about their opinions and views. I like this because most of the time I work with elementary education students and we often have the same views on things, so it is nice to be able to work with people who may have views different than my own. ",DKI
"Hi J! - I agree with you and have the same idea about creating a safe and interactive community in the classroom.  Even if the community is build upon interactive ways online I agree that we can use similar strategies in order to be successful.  Keeping an open mind and listening to what others have to say about certain topics is vital and good practice for future jobs, relationships and learning experiences.",MKC
"For this discussion post I chose to create a bubble map. _I believe that an online community includes connecting with others, the initial experience and engagement with the participants and benefits to the online community. _Above in the bubble map I decided to break each category up.Online communities are very similar to communities in the classroom. _For example, I am an elementary education major and one of my main goals as a future educator is to create a safe and collaborative learning community in my classroom, from peer to peer and teacher to peers. _I want everyone to feel comfortable sharing and have the opportunity to support one another and team together in order to have a successful learning experience. _Going off of this idea in the classroom - online communities are no different. _Online communities may seem harder to collaborate via the internet (no face to face time) and because of this it is extremely important for all participants to be committed and willing to think outside the box while collaborating online.",DKI

What a great way to express your view of an online community. Very creative!,SKC
"Hi L, What a great bubble map you created! I definitely agree that it may be harder for collaboration to happen in online classes because there is no face to face time and people must be willing to put in the effort for the class. But I definitely think that collaboration can happen in online classes if everyone is willing to put in the work. ",MKC
"An online leaning community is a destination on the Internet where where the needs of members are addressed through individual-to-individual sharing of knowledge and information (Online learning community, Wikipedia). Such a community is aimed at fostering the learning needs of members by using social networking or computer applications such as texts, audio, or video. The literature does not describe a pre-determined look or feel for an online learning community. However, it is important for members to feel a sense of belonging and that their learning needs are addressed by participation.One common example of a learning community is Community of practice, defined as ""a group of people who share a craft and/or a profession"" (Community of practice, Wikipedia). Those who form or belong to a community of practice do so to advance their professional objectives by sharing knowledge related to their particular field or profession.",MKI

"Based on my experience online and on what Iêve read so far, I believe that community is important to the success of online spaces, and especially to the construction of learning online. Social constructivist theory posits that learning is created as a social activity, so it would seem necessary to foster learning through the development of community. And George Siemensê theory of connectivity talks about developing and maintaining connections between people as critical to constructing learning. Many of the papers I read for the Intro to LT class described cooperative and transformative learning as needing a high degree of interaction among students and also between students and teachers to succeed. I would like to read more about the relationship between online community development and transformational learning.When an online community really works, perhaps it can draw its participants back inside again and again in the same way as a student hangout (of the brick-and-mortar variety) might_in the same way as the student room in the East Asian Studies department did when I was an undergrad. Maybe it can become the place people want to be for interesting discussion and encouragement and learning. I would like to learn more about ways to construct online spaces that nourish that sort of inviting environment that feels appealing, supportive, and challenging, so that students develop the intrinsic motivation to log on often_to see our friends and colleagues and learn something new from each other.",MKI

"Hi F,I am intrigued by your thoughts/comments about drawing participants back inside again and again. _I think about student hangout spaces and it can often start with students simply being in the same grade level or same class so they have this commonality to start with. _But, I think it's more than that. _I think when an instructor creates space in the beginning of his/her classes to let students get to know one another in meaningful ways it pays off dividends in the end. _This involves creating activities or using instructional strategies that ""force"" students to pay attention to one another. _We are experiencing this strategy right this moment! _I can't say the same for other classes I'm taking. _In fact, after one of my classes last week this one person I left at the same time, rode the elevator down 11 flights and we didn't say a peep to one another. _The instructor hasn't set it up for us to get to know one another and I just didn't have it in me to put myself out there. _I didn't have neither the comfort socially nor the content of the course to lean on to start a conversation. _However, even this minimal interaction we are having in this threaded discussion, I know I'd not only feel comfortable talking to you, I'd likely even feel confident enough to initiate it!",SKC

"Hi M,I have had the same type of experiences in other classes that you described...our instructor did not create time for get to know you type activities.

"Yes. I think one of the reasons it can do that is because we communicate in writing, which allows us--especially those of us who are introverted--to consider first, and then respond. We can re-read what has been said and think about the conversation as a whole. We can address a comment to a particular person and take time to acknowledge others' responses to our comments... And it seems to me that we've covered more ground in this thread than we might have in a typical class discussion. So, yes.",MKC

"Hi M, what an amazing comment! I am very interested in this paragraph : ""I am intrigued by the difference between presence and interaction as described on page 12. _I think about some stories I have read about how people have become actually lonelier or depressed through social media such as Facebook (FB). _In most of these stories the key was that on FB and other social media people are marketing themselves. _That is, they are posting images of themselves on vacation or some other fantastic place because they want to show the world how great their life is. _Itês almost like marketing a product. _If this is true, then wouldnêt that be considered presence, but not true interaction? _As in, the comments below the wonderful picture, _looks like fun,Ó _you look amazing!Ó, etc.? _It seems to me friends are acknowledging presence not truly interacting. _OK, donêt get me wrong, I am just as guilty of this stuff as anyone_Iêm just contemplating this idea. "" it seems like a psychological issue about people's behavior patterns in social networking sites. I totally agree with the viewpoint that this kind of presence in FB is not true interaction. But I do believe Facebook has its potential to engage people in true interactions. If we take advantage of FB in our online courses, we should think carefully about the curriculum design.",MKC
"Hi M and R,The difference between presence and interaction caught my eye too. As far as FB goes, I wonder if the real interaction (such as it is) on FB happens less on public posts and walls, but more in the private messaging. So there are almost two sides to how we present our virtual identity on FB - the attention-getting public side of pictures and status updates, and the more personal, true interaction on the private side. It also makes me wonder to what extent a online community is strengthened when its members know each other offline - perhaps we can understand better the ""meaning between the words"" when we read text from someone we know personally, but on the other hand, we have to work harder to make ourselves understood and to understand others when we only have their words to go off of.",DKC
"Hi, O,I read some articles about how to form online community in FB. It mentioned learners used FB group in online collaboration rather than merely used individual accounts to make communications. But I have never used FB group before, maybe we could try it in this course :)",DKC
"Your comments that we can't assume our way into community based on a presupposition of shared values and beliefs reminds me that all relationship, to be meaningful and productive, require work. I think it's good to remember that we have to put forth an effort to experience the benefits of community, in this class and in all of our communities",MKC
"Again, so sorry to be late to the conversation!Sometimes it's helpful to define by negation: What groups of people would not count as community? What online groups would not count as an online community? (And then what word would we use to describe them?)For some reason I thought of the reviews on Amazon.com (and similar sites). I use reviews whenever making a purchase - but I wonder if that would qualify as a community. Definitely it is a group of people constructing knowledge together, and there is some level of trust that the people posting reviews have in fact used the product. However, there isn't any extended relationship with each other. I don't think most of us would count that as an ""online community"" in the way we've been talking about them, but I can't think of a word that I would use to describe that group of people besides ""community"". Words can be tricky...I think the internet is bringing people together into collections that maybe we don't have specific words for yet. ",MKI

"First of all, i am so sorry for late posting and it won't happen again i promise.After I read the chapter one and some researches from UMN library about online learning community, the first word came up my head was ""small challenge."" The term community is generally defined as usually small, social unit of any size that shares common values. So based on this definition online learning community is the small social unit of any size that shares learning about some topic through online. The reason i called it as small challenge is that the online class has some differences form the off line class and due to those differences it could be more challenging than normal class. I have taken three online classes and the online class needs more participation and responsibility than normal class i think. According to text book, learning in the distance education environment cannot be passive. Students are not only responsible for logging on but they must also contribute to the learning process by posting their thoughts and ideas to the online discussion. Learning is an active process in which both the instructor and the learners must participate it if it is to be successful.",MKI

"P, I like how you used the word ""small challenge"" to describe what online learning communities are. I believe that taking online classes allow one to feel more comfortable to add what they like to any conversation after thinking through what they want to say. I personally feel that asking and answering questions in a large lecture room is more intimidating because once the question is asked, you have to jog your memory as fast as you can to come up with an answer. It is a challenge though to keep up with the course work for online learning communities and to really read so you know what you are writing about.",MKC
"I see community as a group of people sharing the same area of interest or experience - and in thinking about the Community of Practice, I was drawn to Richard Millington's statement that, ""Every online community lives within an ecosystem. Even a community that defines its ecosystem is still encompassed within it."" He goes on to say that, ""To make matters more confusing, a community can exist in more than one ecosystem."" So, I think of my profession of dental hygiene, living within the ecosystem of organized dentistry. Every-so-often, state Boards of Dentistry make major changes to the individual services that a dental hygienist can legally provide to their patients. So, this larger ecosystem change can greatly impact my dental hygiene community. Additionally, these dental hygiene members can be affected by other ecosystems, like the dental insurance ecosystem, which could decide that having one's teeth cleaned, x-rayed and examined should no longer be a covered benefit, which would have profound effects on both my dental hygiene community and its larger ecosystem of organized dentistry, at a minimum. So, this has caused me to think about community not as an insular, members-only club, but rather as a dynamic group which is constantly acting and reacting to what's taking place both within and without the community - the ""issues, media, people, competition and trends"" (Millington) affecting this group of people are what really constitute an online community.",MKI

"As I read through everyone's definitions of online communities, I noticed a lot of recurring concepts and words. Many people mentioned participation, engagement, interaction, feeling comfortable or safe with the other community members, sharing a common purpose or goal, and creating knowledge through collaboration. Those who answered the question of whether community is important in online spaces said, ""Yes."" The reasons circled back to the benefits that showed up in the definitions--it encourages engagement, which is linked to student performance and satisfaction, it facilitates collaboration.I also found the many differences and differing perspectives interesting. I appreciated reading what everyone had to say.",DKC
"I read this article for another class in this week -- From Moodle to Facebook: Exploring students' motivation and experie.... I wanna use some citations in this article to summarize this topic-- ""what's a good online learning community"". 1. a strong online learning community should have its social and emotional as well as intellectual and academic dimensions; 2.the presence of a community is necessary for online participation and learning, and for a need to maintain the balance between interaction for social purposes and that for learning;3. the social presence of learners and instructors helps form the sense of community, and it's also necessary to make roles of members, and rules of community.Anyway, this is an interesting article. You guys could check it out if you are also interested in online social learning :)",SKI
"I wanted to add, that what I've learned from my brief exposure to online learning - and I am lucky enough to have learned best practices in online instruction from the experts here at the U - is the critical role that community plays in these environments. And I have found myself compelled to share this critical element with faculty here in my own discipline, who are planning to develop online courses without the benefit of this coursework in CI.For example, a colleague of mine, who heads a program here, is hiring an instructional designer to help her _develop a hybrid graduate degree program - and she mentioned using Moodle. I was compelled to send her the grid I developed last semester, comparing the social affordances of the two systems, and letting her know of the importance of this sense of community/social aspect of online learning, vs. using a far more limited content management system like Moodle. I hope she will consider this, for the long-term success of her graduate program, where one of the goals in this digital age *should* be to form important relationships that people will carry with them into their professional life. Community is key in online learning.",DKI
"Instructor and S, considering the important social interaction seems to be and how limited you both have found Moodle to be (I'm pretty new to Moodle, and haven't had the time to evaluate it), what do you suppose we in LT can do to encourage the University to consider either moving away from Moodle, or--if that is unlikely, and at this moment it appears to be--adding affordances to Moodle somehow? Is that work underway? (Am I being completely naive?)",MKC
"S, Instructor, F, I so appreciate the information in these comments! I wasn't sure if I was the only one who couldn't stand Moodle, but I could never put my finger on exactly why :-) It totally is the emphasis of content over engagement...and as someone who hopes do instructional design for the U someday, hopefully that will change at some point!",MKC
"Thanks for the acknowledgement, Instructor. I've used Moodle, and as you mentioned to Tracey, it would be very difficult to change OIT and ATS to support a different CMS. Moodle does take some time getting used to, but OIT does see it as an effective tool for students and faculty at the U of M, and currently that's what they support. I do know of other faculty that are using other CMS's like Coursera to create their own online learning course, so it will be interesting to see how things evolve in the future. For those that can't stand Moodle, I would suggest taking some time and really learning the ins and outs of its use...",DKC
"Wow, great comments, everyone! Makes me wonder even more what enhancements/modules/add-ons might be able to be implemented to Moodle to increase its affordances for engagement an interaction.
